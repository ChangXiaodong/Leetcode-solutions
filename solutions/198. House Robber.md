------

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.



Solution:

dp问题，非连续自数组最大和问题。

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])

第i个最大的数为前i-1个最大的数或i-2个最大的数和当前最大数。

空间复杂O(n)， 可以降为O(1)

    def rob(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return max(nums) if nums else 0
        dp = [0 for _ in range(len(nums))]
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(nums[:2])
        res = 0
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])
        return max(dp)

```
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    n = len(nums)
    if n <= 2:
        return max(nums)
    include = 0
    exclude = 0
    for v in nums:
        temp = include
        include = exclude + v
        exclude = max(temp, exclude)
    return max(include, exclude)
```
