Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

```
        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5

```

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes `2` and `8` is `6`. Another example is LCA of nodes `2` and `4` is `2`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.



Solution:

二分查找思想，如果当前节点的纸小于p和q的最小值，就向右查找。若果大于p和q的最大值就向左查找。如果在pq之间就返回当前节点。


    def help(self, node, p, q):
        if node.val > max(p.val, q.val):
            return self.help(node.left, p, q)
        if node.val < min(p.val, q.val):
            return self.help(node.right, p, q)
        return node
    
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if not root:
            return root
        return self.help(root, p, q)
