Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

```
        _______3______
       /              \
    ___5__          ___1__
   /      \        /      \
   6      _2       0       8
         /  \
         7   4
```

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes `5` and `1` is `3`. Another example is LCA of nodes `5` and `4` is `5`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

```
def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
	if root in (None, p, q):
		return root
	left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
	right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
	if left and right:
		return root
	return left if left else right
```

如果root等于p或q，则说明找到了p或q，则返回root。如果为空，则返回空。

left存储在左子树找到的结果，right存储在右子树找到的结果。

如果left和right都不为空，说明当前root节点的左右子树找到了p和q，则返回root
