You are climbing a stair case. It takes *n* steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given *n* will be a positive integer.



Solution:

本质上就是费布那齐数列。主要记住费布那齐数列的非递归求法。

```
class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        else:
            bbefore = 0
            before = 1
            steps = 0
            steps = bbefore + before
            for i in range(n-1):
                bbefore = steps
                steps += before
                before = bbefore
            return steps
```
